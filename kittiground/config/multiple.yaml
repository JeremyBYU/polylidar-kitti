# Polygon Extraction Settings
polygon: # Settings for polygons extraction
  polylidar: # Parameters we send to polylidar. Determine plane and polygon extracton from point clouds.
    lmax: 1.25 # maximum distance (m) between points in plane for spatial connection
    zThresh: 0.04 # triangles with z-height (m) less than this have normal filtering skipped. For sensor noise.
    normThresh: 0.985 # triangles whose normal is greater than X degrees are filtered acos(tri_norm * [0,0,1])
    normThreshMin: 0.90 # mininum level of planarity needed
    minTriangles : 3500 # mininum number of triangles in a plane
    minHoleVertices : 6 # mininum number of vertices in a hole to return
    alpha: 0.0 # must be set to 0.0 if using lmax
  postprocess: # post processing of polygons returned from polylidar for ground/obstacle identification
    filter: # Fitler polygons
      hole_area: # obstacle (holes in polygons) must have these characteristics
        min: 0.5   # m^2
        max: 40 # m^2
      hole_vertices: # obstacles (holes in polygons) must have these characteristics
        min: 3 # A linear ring has a mininum of 3 vertices
      plane_area: # planes must have these area
        min: 30 # m^2
      num_planes_allowed: 1 # TODO Only allow this many largest planes through
    # These parameters correspond to Shapely polygon geometry operations
    positive_buffer: 0.02 # m, Positvely expand polygon.  Fills in small holes
    buffer: 0.3 # m, Negative buffer to polygon. Expands holes and constricuts outer hull of polygon
    simplify: 0.2  # m, simplify edges of polygon

# Recording Settings
